1. Add GUI options:-
	*Octaves DONE
	*Shape (Do everything else first then this so I can not apply FBM Can remove later if needed))
	*Size/dimensions DONE
	*Position DONE
	*Colour DONE
	*Lighting
		*General DONE
		*I will need to be able to set to either directional or point through!!! DONE
		*IF COMMENT AND CLEANING DONE Multiple lights
	*Ray Tracing Steps DONE
	*Smoothing loops DONE

1.5 Possible memory leaks at octaves and smoothsteps so worth a fix!
