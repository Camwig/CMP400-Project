- Setup the Gui so I can set objects such as shapes octaves perlin position and size etc. 
	
-Setup a system that can decide between diffrent functions to determine the distance field
 how I would do this immediatley isI could put these functions to calculate these objects 
 under a single struct/pointer so I can pass it in along with the 
 location which I will also need to include as a struct with the shape

-Setup the profiler for performance

-Fix the vertex based perlin stuff and set that Fractional Brownain motion

-Try and add smoothing to both if there is time! Added smoothing to vertex will try on
 distance fields now.

-POSSIBLE EXTRA after improving general performance as much as I can could look into
 making use of the compute shader to try and improve efficecny by making use of group
 shared memeory.
